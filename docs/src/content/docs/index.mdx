## What is NANO?

NANO is a lightweight JavaScript runtime built with Zig and V8 that hosts multiple applications in a single process using V8 isolates. Think of it like a browser with tabs — each tab is an isolated app, but they share one process.

**Skip the container fleet entirely.** One NANO process replaces dozens of Node containers, their image builds, fleet management, and routing infrastructure — while maintaining isolation between apps.
